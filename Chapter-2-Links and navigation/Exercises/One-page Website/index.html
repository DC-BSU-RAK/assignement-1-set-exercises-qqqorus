<!-- One-page website :ballot_box_with_check:

Pick a television series, film or game and design a really simple one-page website (just text, no images). Your website should include:

* An overview of the plot, key information, cast and/or creative team, characters and any reviews you can find. 
* A nav bar at the top which allows the user to quickly navigate to sections further down the page (anchor Ids).
* A link to the actual website of the film/game etc. which opens in a new tab when clicked. 
* Use of an external CSS file to style elements creatively (avoid inline styling and use classes instead).
* At least two classes. 
* One link styled as a button. -->

                <p class="review"><b>Valerie Kalfrin</b> &emsp;WICKED unfolds with the pop and panache of an interactive storybook, its music, 
                    costumes, art direction, and production design crafting a rich theatrical experience.</p>
                <p class="review"><b>Jeff Beck</b> &emsp;Featuring a pair of outstanding, Oscar-nominated performances from Cynthia Erivo and 
                    Ariana Grande, a fantastic supporting cast, and a marvelous creative team, this is an adaptation that hits all the 
                    right notes.</p>
                <p class="review"><b>Reginald Ponder</b> &emsp;While green could symbolize envy, jealousy, and the unknown, Elphaba is 
                    unapologetically who she is, leaving me to exclaim, “I want to be seen in green.” Wickedly entertaining and thought-provoking.</p>
                <p class="review"><b>Sarah Ward</b> &emsp;Jon M Chu has a knack as a filmmaker of stage hits reaching cinemas: matching the vibe 
                    of the show he's taking on expertly.</p>

            <a name="Trivia"><h1>Trivia</h1></a>
                <p class="trivia">As well as extensive CGI environments, some practical sets were built. Director Jon M. Chu wanted the world 
                    of Oz to feel like a real place for the actors and actresses, rather than just a computer-generated background. 
                    This included planting 9 million tulips to serve as part of the landscape for Munchkinland, although for wider shots 
                    VFX was still used.</p>
                <p class="trivia">The vocals for the ensemble parts were prerecorded by a number of Broadway performers including some alumni 
                    from Wicked on Broadway, as opposed to being sung live on set like the lead vocals were.</p>
                <p class="trivia">The horse Fiyero rides in this film is Jack, the horse Jonathan Bailey rode in Bridgerton (2020). 
                    Bailey reportedly felt a connection to Jack when making that series, so he asked to ride Jack in this movie.</p>
