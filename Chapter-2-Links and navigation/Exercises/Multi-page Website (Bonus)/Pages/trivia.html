        <h3>&emsp;Trivia</h3>
        <p class="trivia">As well as extensive CGI environments, some practical sets were built. 
            Director Jon M. Chu wanted the world of Oz to feel like a real place for the actors and actresses, 
            rather than just a computer-generated background. This included planting 9 million tulips to serve 
            as part of the landscape for Munchkinland, although for wider shots VFX was still used.</p>
        <p class="trivia">The vocals for the ensemble parts were prerecorded by a number of Broadway performers 
            including some alumni from Wicked on Broadway, as opposed to being sung live on set like the lead vocals were.</p>
        <p class="trivia">The leading duo insisted on singing live during filming. According to director Jon M. Chu, 
            "When we were shooting it, those girls were like, 'F--- the pre-records. We're going live.'" 
            He was initially skeptical of this, since there would be "a lot of wind" in their air pipes as they performed 
            the more complex sequences while maintaining their singing voices. They simply replied, "Yeah. That's what we do."</p>
        <p class="trivia">The horse Fiyero rides in this film is Jack, the horse Jonathan Bailey rode in Bridgerton (2020). 
            Bailey reportedly felt a connection to Jack when making that series, so he asked to ride Jack in this movie.</p>
