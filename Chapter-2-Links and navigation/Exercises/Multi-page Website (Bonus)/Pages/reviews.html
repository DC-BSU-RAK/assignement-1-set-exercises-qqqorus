            This is a sumptuous and unsubtle treat grounded in Erivo’s graceful and subtle performance. When she defies gravity, 
            she lifts us with her, and we lean forward to the next chapter.</p>
        <p class="review"><b>Mark Kermode</b>&emsp;<span id="star">&starf;&starf;&starf;&starf;&#11242;</span><br><br>
            The songs are bangers and they are performed with note-perfect gusto by people who can really sing.</p> 
        <p class="review"><b>Kyle Smith</b>&emsp;<span id="star">&starf;&starf;&starf;&starf;&starf;</span><br><br>
            "Wicked" is the most entertaining film of the year and the most dazzling live-action Hollywood musical since “Chicago.” 
            To put it in the kind of lingo used in Oz, I pronuncify it magnifical..</p> 
        <p class="review"><b>Fatima Sheriff</b>&emsp;<span id="star">&starf;&starf;&starf;&#11242;&star;</span><br><br>
            Though the run time may seem excessive (two hours and 40 minutes?!), it is a testament to Chu and his team’s care 
            that each musical number is carefully built up and celebrated with elaborate set pieces.</p>

            A solid film, though I wanted it to end before it ended and some visuals were a bit inconsistent</p>
        <p class="review"><b>Audrey</b>&emsp;<span id="star">&starf;&starf;&starf;&starf;&starf;</span><br><br>
            Loved the story, the cinematography was amazing. All of the actors have beautiful voices that help bring the story to life!</p> 
        <p class="review"><b>Megan C</b>&emsp;<span id="star">&starf;&starf;&starf;&star;&star;</span><br><br>
            Was decent, some words were hard to make out with all the singing, they weren’t clear.</p> 
        <p class="review"><b>Jeremy W</b>&emsp;<span id="star">&starf;&starf;&starf;&star;&star;</span><br><br>
            Kind of annoying. Even so, the performances are great, the songs brilliantly belted out, and a final visual world to experience.</p>
