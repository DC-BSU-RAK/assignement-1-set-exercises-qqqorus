            Chicken Afritada or afritadang manok is a type of Filipino chicken stew with tomato based sauced. 
            It is a simple dish that can be cooked on regular days. It is perfect for lunch and is better when eaten with warm white rice. 
            The basic version includes carrots and potato.

        <h2>How did Chicken Afritada come to be?</h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">
            As far as tomato-based viands in the Philippines go, Chicken Afritada stands as one of the most famous. 
            Practically every household has their own rendition of the delicious Apritadang Manok. 
            It’s go its delicious share of potatoes, peas, and that unmistakably flavorful and thick orange stew. 
            But do you know how this dish actually came to life? It might surprise you to know that this is mainly because of how 
            Filipino cooks learned to pan-fry their food.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">
            We may be familiar with a good deal of Filipino recipes that arose in the Spanish colonization era that lasted until 1898. 
            But Afritada, in particular, came to life because of the cooking method of pan-frying that the Spaniards brought over. 
            Filipino cooks went on to formulate the idea of a recipe wherein the cook would start off by pan-frying potatoes, carrots and 
            other vegetables, as well as chicken. This is before we leave it to stew in a savory mix of garlic, bay leaves, and more 
            delightfully complementary seasonings.
