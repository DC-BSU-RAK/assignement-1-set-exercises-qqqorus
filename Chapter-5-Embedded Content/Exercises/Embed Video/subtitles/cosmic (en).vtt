00:00:08.161 --> 00:00:11.340
A far-flung star, that Funny story

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.709
(It’s electric)

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:14.843
That Landing so turbulent

00:00:14.843 --> 00:00:18.933
Meeting you as the stars would have it

00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:20.917
First star was too cold

00:00:20.917 --> 00:00:23.181
So went galaxy-hopping

00:00:23.181 --> 00:00:26.373
Into this uninvited crash-landing

00:00:26.373 --> 00:00:28.512
A stranger to me, you are

00:00:28.512 --> 00:00:29.664
Should I ignore you?

00:00:29.664 --> 00:00:31.976
I can&#39;t get you off my mind

00:00:31.976 --> 00:00:33.119
So just to pass time

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:34.260
Should I troll you?

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.092
Hey, what did you do to my mind?

00:00:37.092 --> 00:00:40.484
I wanna know you

00:00:40.484 --> 00:00:43.836
Maybe all night I could throw questions

00:00:43.836 --> 00:00:46.334
(When the stars align)

00:00:46.334 --> 00:00:48.389
You said if the sky&#39;s clear tonight

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:51.168
Tomorrow you&#39;ll be taking off, but

00:00:51.168 --> 00:00:53.511
I got a plan, just you and I

00:00:53.511 --> 00:00:56.499
How about you stay a little longer?

00:00:56.499 --> 00:01:00.704
My star tells me she&#39;s a bit lonely

00:01:02.008 --> 00:01:05.737
Sing this hidden song to you, if you let me

00:01:05.737 --> 00:01:07.793
Love is Cosmic

00:01:07.793 --> 00:01:10.313
I’m riding on your rhythm

00:01:10.313 --> 00:01:12.417
Through the solar system

00:01:12.417 --> 00:01:14.423
Come with me

00:01:15.628 --> 00:01:19.324
You and I, crossing the night

00:01:19.324 --> 00:01:22.147
Cosmic love

00:01:22.147 --> 00:01:23.977
Riding your rhythm

00:01:23.977 --> 00:01:26.218
Through the solar system

00:01:26.218 --> 00:01:28.354
Wanna know you more

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:31.753
Cosmic love

00:01:34.464 --> 00:01:37.840
Never had this feeling before

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.120
Thought about it hard, but, still remains a question mark

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.528
Even this strange ruckus

00:01:44.528 --> 00:01:47.032
Even to you I&#39;m a stranger

00:01:47.032 --> 00:01:49.394
You&#39;d stare like you&#39;re seeing an alien

00:01:49.394 --> 00:01:52.098
You know that could be hurtful

00:01:52.098 --> 00:01:57.573
On my star, time flows slowly

00:01:57.573 --> 00:02:01.282
You don&#39;t have to rush

00:02:01.282 --> 00:02:03.131
(When the stars align)

00:02:03.131 --> 00:02:05.370
Perhaps we&#39;re travelers searching

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.357
For orphaned dreams

00:02:08.357 --> 00:02:10.666
Shooting stars lost and wandering

00:02:10.666 --> 00:02:13.498
How about you stay a little longer?

00:02:13.498 --> 00:02:17.881
My star tells me she&#39;s a bit lonely

00:02:19.138 --> 00:02:22.818
Sing this hidden song to you, if you let me

00:02:22.818 --> 00:02:24.811
Love is Cosmic

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:27.234
I’m riding on your rhythm

00:02:27.234 --> 00:02:29.434
Through the solar system

00:02:29.434 --> 00:02:31.961
Come with me

00:02:32.726 --> 00:02:36.279
You and I, crossing the night

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:39.064
Cosmic love

00:02:39.841 --> 00:02:41.910
A striding step towards me

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.001
Stretch out your star-tanned hand

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:51.097
&quot;Come with me,&quot; you say

00:02:51.097 --> 00:02:54.483
&quot;Discover things no human eyes have seen,&quot; you say

00:02:54.483 --> 00:02:59.551
I just can’t say goodnight

00:03:04.696 --> 00:03:07.520
I can never say goodnight

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.203
‘Cause your love is Cosmic

00:03:10.203 --> 00:03:12.535
I’m riding on your rhythm

00:03:12.535 --> 00:03:14.713
Through the solar system

00:03:14.713 --> 00:03:17.681
Come with me

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:21.541
You and I, crossing the night

00:03:21.541 --> 00:03:24.322
Cosmic love

00:03:24.322 --> 00:03:26.135
Leaving tonight

00:03:26.135 --> 00:03:28.455
Find the stars hidden from sight

00:03:28.455 --> 00:03:30.546
Let us name them alright

00:03:30.546 --> 00:03:33.735
Cosmic love

00:03:33.735 --> 00:03:35.918
Riding your rhythm (Ride this night)

00:03:35.918 --> 00:03:37.630
Through the solar system

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.584
Wanna know you more

00:03:39.584 --> 00:03:43.454
Cosmic love oh yeah
